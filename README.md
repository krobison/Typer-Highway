Typer-Highway
=============

A project for my Sophomore intro to c++ class. Uses OpenFrameworks for graphics.

In order to run, make sure to download openframeworks, and change the directory in the visual studio project file
(finalProject.sln) so that it points to the correct directory. By default, this is:
"..\..\..\libs\openFrameworksCompiled\project\vs2010\openframeworksLib.vcxproj"
